# Tailscale Developer Community

Welcome to the developer community for Tailscale! This organization is
the home for a lot of experimental ideas, peer directed projects, and
overall for tools to help make your life easier when working with
Tailscale.

## 🤔✍️ Why we're doing this

Let's face it, networking is hard. There are a lot of things that you
can do with computer networks. A product like tail scale helps you
break down the barriers in your internal network so that you can focus
on what you like doing more than worrying about the minutiae of
security, or reliability, or all of the stuff involved with the cloud.
We want to help you be productive. We want you to have the same kind
of mind bending experiences that we've had when building Tailscale.

This is the home of our experiments, our ideas, are hopes, our
dreams, and hopefully so much more in the future. Normally when we
put things  like this out into the world, we don't really know what
people are going to do with them and there's not really a good way
for people to give feedback or improve them. Everything in this
organization is designed to be contributed to, improved upon, and so
much more that we can't even imagine yet.

this a community hub for everyone that uses Tailscale. We also can't
wait to see what you create.
